Task3 is used to Improve our mask with the commands Opening, Closing, Dilation, etc. from Matlab.
Task3Comparacio is used to Compare this new improved masks to the ones we had before (always talking about the validation_split made in week1).

  Inside Task3 there are implemented the next functions:
                              -Mejora
                              
                            
  Inside "Task3Comparacio" there are implemented the functions:
                              -TesteigMask        --> PerformanceAcumulationPixel   &    PerformanceEvaluationPixel
                              -Calculate Average
