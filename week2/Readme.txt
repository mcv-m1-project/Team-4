Task3 is used to Improve our mask with the commands Opening, Closing, Dilation, etc. from Matlab.
To Execute Task3 you need to have a directory name called 'test' where the masks from week 1 are separated in order the different traffic signals (A, B, C,etc). 
Task3Comparacio is used to Compare this new improved masks to the ones we had before (always talking about the validation_split made in week1).

Inside Task3 there are implemented the next functions:
                              -Mejora
                                                        
Inside "Task3Comparacio" there are implemented the functions:
                              -TesteigMask        --> PerformanceAcumulationPixel   &    PerformanceEvaluationPixel
                              -Calculate Average
                              
If you want to execute 2nd part of Task 3 (used as an improvement for the test masks of week1 to upload to the virtual server) you need to discomment the 2nd part and to comment the 1st one.
Also you need a directory inside 'test/test/images' where you have all the images and another called 'test/test/masks' where you have the masks to improve.
