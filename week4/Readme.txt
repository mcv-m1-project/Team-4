#Week 4 (Team 4)

Task 0:

In this Task, we have created the function createTemplate() to create 4 different temaples (Binary, Color, Grayscale and Edge) for each shape (Up Triangle, Down Triangle, Circle and Square). Before we have created the function getProperties() to obtain the bounding box area and the form factor for each type of signal.

Task 1:

In this Task, we implement the correlation between our templates from task0 with our masks. For that, we use the functions "PaintMask", which changes the masks to remove all the noise and images that are not signals and keeps only our windows Candidates, and also the function "ReadMat", which computes the names in order to load all the .mat and .png from previous weeks.
