Task 1:

In this Task we implemented the Connected Component Labeling (CCL) algorithm. We have used the masks obtained in the masks obtained in the Week 2 after applying morphological operators in the space HSV.
Finally we obtained the windows candidates and we have saved it as a .mat file.

Task 2:

In this second Task we implemented the Sliding Window algorithm. To decide the appropiate size of the window that we will use, he have create a GetWindowSize() function. This Function using the .txt training information calculate de "mean window". This window will be used in the following tasks.
Finally we obtained the windows candidates and we have saved it as a .mat file.

Task 3:

In this third Task we implemented the Integral Image to mprove efficiency of feature computation
